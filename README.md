# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing
This is my intermediate level Python Project to harvest YouTube data using YouTube Data API and store the data in a MongoDB database as a data lake.After that the data is migrated from the data lake to a SQL database as tables and are displayed in the streamlit application.
